## Standalone Usage on Windows

If you're using Windows, you can only download the `Instagram Unfollowers.exe` file. Place your `followers_1.json` and `following.json` files (which you received from your Instagram account) next to the app. Then, simply run the executable. Voila! You can now see all the users who are not following you back.
